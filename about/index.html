            <h4>My Journey and Philosophy</h4>
            <p class="bio">I'm currently a Computer Science and Graphic Design student at Lehigh 
                University, combining art and technology to build cool, interactive experiences. During my time here, I've designed mixed reality research applications featured in professional journals, participated in countless hackathons, and guided peers as a teacher's assistant. I love to explore new ideas while helping others reach theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey officially into design and development started in high school when I took elective classes in graphic design and Unity development. But long before that, I was building Roblox levels and making YouTube thumbnails in MS Paint, unaware that I was laying the initial foundation of my future.
            </p>
            <p>
                My guiding principle is knowledge. I really enjoy helping others, whether it's through 
                teaching coding or design. I'm always curious to learn and willing to share what's 
                possible in both design and development.
            </p>
