            <p><b>Visage</b> is a mixed reality app of the future that allows users to visualize, 
                customize, and  share home decor in their own spaces. It is driven by the community-feed 
                of sharing and experimenting with designs. The project focuses on creating a seamless and 
                intuitive interface that allows users to be able to share and take inspiration from user 
                posted ideas, allowing the ability to build on top of one another's designs.</p>

            
            <p><b>Deliverables: </b>User Interface, Rendered Mockups</p>
            <p><b>Role: </b>Sole UI/UX Designer and User Research</p>
            <p><b>Tools: </b>Figma, UserTesting, Blender</p>
            <p><b>Duration: </b>Fall 2024 — 4 weeks</p>
            <p><b>Key Features of the Product:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take design inspirations from a social feed</li>

            <h4>The Problem</h4>

            <p>The goal of Visage was to explore how a social and home decor app could function in a mixed 
                reality environment, where users could seamlessly share, customize, and experiment with 
                designs.</p>
            <p>The key challenges of the project included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Visualization and Sharing</b>
                    <br>How could users effectively visualize and share their ideas in real-time, allowing 
                    for personal creativity and collaborative sharing?</li>
                <li><b>UI Interaction with Real or Virtual Objects</b>
                    <br>How would the user interface dynamically interact with real-world objects (e.g., 
                    scanning and overlaying designs on existing furniture) or virtual elements cast into 
                    the scene?</li>
                <li><b>Balancing Accessibility and Elegance</b>
                    <br>How can the experience be approachable and intuitive for anyone, making it simple 
                    for new users to browse, customize, and purchase home decor items?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="page-break"></div>

            <h4>Research</h4>

            <p>The research phase of the project began by examining how current social media and virtual 
                home decor apps engage users and foster interactivity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Social Media Apps:</b>
                    Platforms like Instagram and TikTok use gamification (e.g., likes, follower counts, duets) to enhance engagement. This is important for encouraging creativity and building on others' ideas.</li>
                <li><b>Home Decor Apps:</b>
                    Apps like Ikea Kreativ let users visualize furniture in their space, a feature that was similarly incorporated into Visage through it's design mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The key takeaway found is that the merging of gamification and personalization encourages user engagement and accomplishment in their designs.</p>

            <div class="page-break"></div>

            <h4>The Design Process</h4>

            <p>The design involved several stages, from sketching, wireframing, and high-fidelity 
                prototyping. Initially, the project was more focused on home decor, but as feedback through user testing was incorporated, the social aspects gained more emphasis.</p>
            <ul><li><b>Early Wireframes:</b>
                Focused on furniture placement and integrating social aspects of the app.</li></ul>
            <img src="resources/visage_early_concept.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="caption">Early sketches of the user interface for furniture interactions</p>

            <ul><li><b>First Iteration:</b>
                A modern, greyscale UI was chosen, inspired by existing mixed reality and social media designs. Feedback revealed that the grey-on-grey color scheme was too subtle and led to adjustments for better visibility and emphasis on social features.</li></ul>

            <ul><li><b>Final Iteration:</b>
                Refined UI interactions, clearer button labels, and improved social feed functionality based on user feedback. The user flow was made more intuitive, and new design elements were added to make sharing and customizing easier.</li></ul>

            <h4>The Results and What I Learned</h4>
            <p>The Visage project was mostly successful in combining social media dynamics with a virtual home decor experience in a mixed reality environment, showcasing a way for users to interact, customize, and share designs. This project highlighted the following key takeaways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>User-Centered Design is Key:</b>
                    Iterative feedback cycles proved vital in refining the app's design, ensuring it was clear in defining what makes it unique: the social sharing aspect of the app.</li>
                <li><b>Clarity in Flow and Wording Matters:</b>
                    Clear button labels and intuitive navigation significantly improved the user experience, highlighting the importance of concise and understandable wording.</li>
                <li><b>Combining Social and Practical Features:</b>
                    Integrating social interaction with home decor tools, like saving and customizing designs from others, created a unique experience in mixed reality.</li>
            </ul>
